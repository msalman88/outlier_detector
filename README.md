# Simple Outlier Detection

In this project, a simple outlier detection is built using simple moving average for a time series data.
The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction. 

## Objective
We would like to identify the outliers for time series data if they exist using simple moving average.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis is performed and available.
- Different python files are created for different functionaliies.


## How to Run

If you want to run the outlier detector locally, then follow the instructions given below.

- Clone the repository locally.
- Down train.csv file from  https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction and move it to the same folder where the project is clone.
- Run **main.py**
- Results will be saved in the same folder. It will take some time to generate the results because there are **40428966** rows in our dataset.

It's worth having a look at **exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb** that contains useful insights about the dataset we used.
